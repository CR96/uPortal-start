# uPortal Start Manual

These pages contain documentation for using uPortal-start.  They will help you understand and use
the features of uPortal-start, such as the build system and CLI tools.

**NOTE:**  This manual is _not_ a comprehensive reference for configuring each of the modules
included with uPortal-start.  Individual modules typically have their own documentation.  For
example, detailed information for configuring uPortal (one of the modules _"bundled"_ with
uPortal-start) can be found in the [uPortal 5.x Manual][].
