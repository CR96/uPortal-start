# This Dockerfile governs the uPortal Quickstart Docker image.  The portal must be fully assembled
# (based on tomcatInstall + tomcatDeploy) before building the Docker image.

# This image requires Gradle;  it is not as slim as the web server-only image
FROM apereo/uportal-cli

# The behavior of this image is based on a shell script
COPY etc/docker/quickstart.sh quickstart.sh
RUN chmod +x quickstart.sh

# TCP traffic from this image is available on port 8080 (in case the Tomcat instance is started)
EXPOSE 8080

# Containers based on this image are expected to invoke the Gradle-based CLI
ENTRYPOINT ["./quickstart.sh"]
