/*
 * NOTE:  This bundled app is a more recent copy of the ResourceServingWebapp.
 *
 * For releases beginning with 1.1.0, the resource-server-content module removed some older versions
 * of several libraries.  uPortal, however, still depends on some of those libraries, and currently
 * won't work without a copy of ResourceServingWebapp.  For webjar support, on the other hand, we
 * need version 1.3.x.  So (for now) we will run two copies.
